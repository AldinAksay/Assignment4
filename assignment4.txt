1. How can you concatenate strings in C?
	You need to remove the \0 from the end of one string, and add the characters from the second string to it. You can also use the strcat () function.

2. If a static array is not initialized, what will the size automatically be set to?
	It automatically initializes to 0, and there is an error.

3. How would you declare a multidimensional array of size 64? Explain your answer. 
	We would declare it a datatype arrayName[dim1size] [dim2size], underneath of which you write the ints. This is to get results from each array. 	
4. In your own words, explain what each of the following functions does and returns:
	a. strcmp(): this function compares two strings. It returns if one string is less than another, or if they are equal.

	b. fgets(): this function reads a line from a stream, and stores it in a string. It stops when n-1 characters are read, the newline character is read, or it reaches the end of the program. If the program is successful, it returns the same first-string parameter. If not, it returns a null pointer. If it reaches the end of the file without reading anything, the contents of the first string do not change. Basically, it can be used as a scanf for strings.

	c. strcat(): this function adds a specified string to the end of another specifiedstring. It returns a pointer to the resulting string.

	d. strlen(): this function computest the length of a string, not including the null pointer. It returns the length of the string.
