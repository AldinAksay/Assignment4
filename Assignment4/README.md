# Assignment 4

## Objectives

To gain a solid understanding of arrays and strings in C.

### Part 1

1.  Write a program `sum.c` given an array of n integers where n > 1, return an array of same size as the input array where every index of the output array is the cumulative sum of elements in the array so far. You can have it so that the array is input by the user.

2.  Write a program `vowels.c` that takes a string as input, removes vowels, and outputs the new string.

3.  Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. Name this program `unique.c`.


### Part 2

1.  How can you concatenate strings in C? 
2.  If a static array is not initialized, what will the size automatically be set to? 
3.  How would you declare a multidimensional array of size 64? Explain your answer. 
4.  In your own words, explain what each of the following functions does and returns:
      - strcmp() 
      - fgets()
      - strcat() 
      - strlen()
